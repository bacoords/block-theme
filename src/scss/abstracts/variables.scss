This map is used for a mobile first responsive coding
approach mixin in _mixins.scss. Breakpoint names are
inspired by bodies of water, because they expand and
shrink with the weather. These denote some default
screen breaks. More can be added if needed.

Vocabulary options: pond, brook, creek, gulf, sea.
