How to SCSS in Tangent
======================
## A Design Token First Approach

Since Tangent is a hybrid theme that takes full advantage of `theme.json`, all styles work in concert with the `theme.json` file. All design tokens (variables, constants, fonts, colors, etc) should be defined `theme.json`. This makes these design tokens available globally throughout the WordPress front-end and accessible through CSS Custom Properties generated by WordPress.

See [the Theme-JSON readme](../theme-json/README.md) for more information on how to set variables and constants in `theme.json`.

## SCSS Architecture

The `scss` architecture in Tangent is inspired by the 7-1 Pattern in [Sass Guidelines Style Guide](https://sass-guidelin.es/), but instead of one root level file, we have two: `global.scss` and `editor.scss`.

`global.scss` is enqueued on the front-end everywhere. All styles excluding your block-specific styles should be enqueued here.

`editor.scss` is enqueued in the Block Editor. Typically you'll want all your files and folders included in this file.

### Folders

The `scss` is divided up into the following 7 folders:

1. `abstracts/` - where you gather your tools and helpers; functions, mixins, variables, those should all be placed in this folder.
2. `base` - this folder is where your base level styles live. All styles affecting HTML elements will typically live here. Think input styles for your forms, heading styles, a reset stylesheet, etc. In other words, these are your _global_ styles.
3. `blocks` - this is where your block-specific styles live. This is a special folder, more on this in a later section.
4. `layout` - this is where styles for the major sections of your website live. Think your header, footer, sidebar, article layout, navigation, etc.
5. `utilities` - This folder is made up of files that do a specific thing. For example, a class for visually hiding elements. These are utility classes you can pull into other files as needed. Each utility file will typically only contain one or two classes.
6. `vendors` - This is where stylesheets from any third-party sources live.

## Folder Guidelines

Each folder should have an `index.scss` file that pulls in its partials using the `@forward` rule. In the `editor.scss` and `global.scss` files you can import entire folders like so:

```scss
@use 'folderName';
```
