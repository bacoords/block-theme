# Base Styles

This folder contains:

- a CSS Reset
- any base typography styles we can't set with `theme.json`
- Form styles

## Tips

If you have a button that shouldn't inherit the default button styles from `forms.scss`, you can give it the class `link-button`, and the styles won't be applied to that button.
