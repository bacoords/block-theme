# Tangent

Tangent is a new starter theme (currently in development) from Understrap. Tangent combines the core values of Understrap, but is also a radical departure from the Understrap toolset.

A few similarities:

- Sensible defaults.
- A fast scaffold for custom development.
- A modern build process that uses `@wordpress/scripts`.
- A "hybrid" (non-FSE) WordPress theme that still uses PHP but embraces the Block Editor.
- Reusable components that are _extremely_ well documented.

And some differences:

- Gutenberg/block-first from the ground up
- No more Bootstrap ðŸ˜® 
- Works _with_ the design language of Gutenberg, instead of against it
- Approachable, but modern, PHP best practices

## Theme Setup

Tangent is a "hybrid" theme, which means that most of the theme setup is handled in the `inc/setup.php` file. This includes:

- Theme supports
- Menus and widgets
- Any custom theme options

Similarly, most of the design setup starts in the `src/theme-json` folder. More on that below.

## Build Process

As of now, this repository does _not_ include the final built assets. You'll need to build them once you've cloned the repo. (You may also want to exclude them from your `.gitignore` file, depending on your workflow.)

`npm run build` will build the theme's CSS, JavaScript files, and theme.json.

`npm run watch` will watch for changes to the theme's SCSS, JavaScript files, and theme.json partials and rebuild them automatically.

### CSS & SCSS

Tangent does enqueue stylesheets for the frontend and the block editor, However, Tangent's superpowers include the ability to pull props _directly from your theme.json_ as well as generate _block-specific CSS files_ and enqueue them to their specific blocks.

### JavaScript

### Theme.json

Tangent uses `.jsonc` partials to store all of the theme's design settings. These smaller partials are automatically compiled into a `theme.json` file for your theme.

### Custom Blocks

Because we're already using `@wordpress/scripts` to build our theme, we can also use it to build our custom blocks. TK

## Navigation Menu

Tangent's `header.php` uses a "classic" WordPress Menu but is enhanced with much of the same front-end updates in the Gutenberg navigation block. This includes a responsive full screen modal and solid accessibility. To accomplish this, Tangent combines a custom navwalker called `Tangent_Navwalker` with additional JavaScript to enable accessible dropdowns for submenus.

## Linting and WordPress Coding Standards

PHP linting is available by running `composer php-lint` from the command line.

Tangent follows the WordPress Coding Standards. You can check your code against the standards by running `composer phpcs` from the command line. You can also run `composer phpcs-fix` to automatically fix any errors that can be fixed automatically.
